# Nonparametric Regression Models  
Contains several models which can be applied to data in a metric space. I will also consider the correlated errors.

## K-NN-FL and epsilon-NN-FL 
See 'example.ipynb'.  

<Explain how it works here.>

## N-W estimator on manifolds
Only 1-dim case.  

## Frechet regression
TODO.
